# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices based on various features such as number of rooms, location, area, and other property attributes. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate the price of a house.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand the dataset and explore features
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Train and evaluate regression models
- Fine-tune the best model for improved accuracy
- Make predictions on new/unseen data

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
- Scikit-learn (for modeling)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Models Used

- Linear Regression
- Ridge & Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree / Random Forest (Optional)
- Cross-validation for model comparison
